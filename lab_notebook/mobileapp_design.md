# Design Goals

- Needs to be usable on a daily basis, user should want to use and check in with the app

- User needs to add in more meals for our system to improve. App shouldn't just be a button to press when they want the drink

- Should be interacting w/ app a lot and that is how we can potentially make more money

- User should be able to add in how they feel, therefore introducing more potential supplements they can buy

- Needs to show the basic carbs fat protein that many people focus on for weight gain/ weight loss.

- Can incorporate protein/electrolytes etc. and market for athletes too

- Looks really really ugly, so working on finding a good color scheme first and a concept

- So far made really big improvements design and user experience wise.

- much more pleasant to use compared to before. sticking w/ black and white with some colored accents to highlight what we want the user to see

# User Experience/Interface and dev

- Since there are so many moving parts (daily checkin, requesting drink, adding meals, etc.) need to figure out a simple way to access all of it

- Spent a lot of time on iconography and buttons to make the design approachable and easily usable for users to use every day

- Planning to split up the main 3 components which are adding meals, requesting drink, and daily checkin to 3 separate cards that you can access from the home page.

- Quick access info that you would want to see right away would be on the home screen such as your calories for the day and the macros that you've had so far along with meas you've eaten.

- Meals can be expanded to see the details for each meal including their micronutrients and what they are lacking in.
